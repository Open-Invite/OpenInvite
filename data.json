      "description": "Considered the “birth place” of California, Old Town San Diego gives visitors a glimpse into San Diego’s colonial period from 1821-1872. Many of the historical sites and museums in this neighborhood have free admission. Over a hundred shops and boutiques line the streets, along with plenty of restaurants. At the center of Old Town is the Whaley House Museum Complex, which consists of five historic buildings, the most famous of which is the Whaley House, the most haunted house in the country according to the Travel Channel’s “America's Most Haunted.”                                                                  View a rare original stagecoach at the Wells Fargo Museum, see a scale model of 19th century Old Town at the reconstructed Robinson-Rose House, and tour the Black Hawk Livery & Blacksmith, the first public schoolhouse in San Diego. Casa de Estudillo is considered one of the finest adobe haciendas in the state. Up the hill you’ll discover Heritage Park, a 7.8 acre county park where seven Victorian homes have been relocated and now house shops, bed and breakfasts, and the Serra Museum, site of California’s first mission and fort."

      "description": "Downtown's Gaslamp Quarter has no shortage of dining options - there's about a half-dozen restaurants on any given block. But on a busy night, you probably don't want to run the risk of showing up late to a show, which is very likely to happen if you didn't take the extra step of making reservations. If you're headed to House of Blues, however, its Crossroads restaurant offers a hearty helping of Cajun and southern cuisine. Indulge in some voodoo shrimp, pulled pork sliders, St. Louis ribs or jambalaya before the lights go down and the volume goes up. The dining room is open until 11:00 PM, so on the rare night the show ends a little early, you can even catch a late-night snack before heading home."

      "description": "The Loft, nestled in a cozy corner of Price Center at UC San Diego in La Jolla, is a music venue, but even more than that, it's an all-purpose social gathering place for students and visitors alike. Several nights a week, it hosts live music from pop, electronic and jazz artists, as well as comedy, poetry and the occasional lecture series. But it's also home to Zanzibar, a café that's open from breakfast through happy hour on most days. The exception, of course, is on nights with live performances, during which you can grab a flatbread, a basket of fries, sliders or wings while you sit back and soak in the music in some of the most comfortable seats in any venue in San Diego. Not a bad way to close out the day."
